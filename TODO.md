#TODO

* Define namespace for the Elemental functions loaded
* Create a package structure and/or include it in elemental building system
    * Create Makevars file, which explicitly links to elemental and the other libraries
    * Document all the functions
* Restrict the functions, so they have datatype requirement specification
* Add the functions for the other datatypes (integer, single, complex and double complex)
* Add more MPI functions that can be useful
* Try to generate more setup values for the functions i.e. orientation="NORMAL" and so on
